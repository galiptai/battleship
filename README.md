# Battleship

My take on the classic 1v1 game, where your aim is to guess where the other player's ships are.

## Features

- Local game
  - Both players play on the same device, taking turns
  - Save system for storing the last unfinished game
- Desktop and mobile friendly

## How to start

*Docker support coming soon!*

In the meantime, you'll need Node.js.
- navigate to the client folder
- install dependencies with ```npm ci```
- when its done, run the application with ```npm run dev```
- you can reach the app on localhost:3000

## Stack
